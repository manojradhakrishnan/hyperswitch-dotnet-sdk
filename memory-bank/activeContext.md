# HyperSwitch .NET SDK - Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The HyperSwitch .NET SDK is currently operational and provides a comprehensive interface to the HyperSwitch Payments API. The focus is on maintaining the SDK, adding new features as the HyperSwitch API evolves, and ensuring compatibility with the latest .NET versions.

## Recent Changes
- Initial repository exploration
- Memory bank creation

## Next Steps
1. **Explore Additional APIs**: Investigate if there are any HyperSwitch API endpoints not currently covered by the SDK
2. **Test Coverage Assessment**: Evaluate the current test coverage and identify areas for improvement
3. **Documentation Review**: Review and enhance documentation for better developer experience
4. **Performance Optimization**: Identify potential performance bottlenecks and optimize

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Coverage
- Ensuring all HyperSwitch API endpoints are properly supported in the SDK
- Maintaining backward compatibility while adding new features

### SDK Design
- Balancing strongly-typed interfaces with flexibility for developers
- Providing both simple and advanced usage patterns

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling strategy for API communication
- Clear and informative exception messages

### Serialization
- Handling snake_case (API) to PascalCase (.NET) conversion efficiently
- Managing serialization edge cases

### Multi-targeting
- Supporting multiple .NET versions (6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0)
- Ensuring consistent behavior across all platforms

## Current Challenges
1. **API Evolution**: Keeping up with changes in the HyperSwitch API
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintaining backward compatibility while adding new features
3. **Documentation**: Ensuring documentation remains up-to-date and comprehensive
4. **Testing**: Comprehensive testing across all supported .NET versions

## Environment Setup
- The SDK is developed and maintained using standard .NET development tools
- Testing requires a HyperSwitch sandbox account for integration tests
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and package publishing
