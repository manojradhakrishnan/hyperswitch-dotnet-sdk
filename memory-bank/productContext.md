# HyperSwitch .NET SDK - Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The HyperSwitch .NET SDK exists to simplify payment integration for .NET developers who want to use HyperSwitch, a payment orchestration platform. Without the SDK, developers would need to manually implement HTTP requests, handle serialization, manage authentication, and handle errors when interacting with the HyperSwitch API.

## Problems It Solves
1. **API Complexity**: Abstracts away the complexities of the HyperSwitch API endpoints and authentication
2. **Type Safety**: Provides strongly-typed models for requests and responses to prevent runtime errors
3. **Error Handling**: Offers comprehensive error handling with detailed exception messages
4. **Development Speed**: Accelerates integration time through a simple, consistent interface
5. **Implementation Consistency**: Ensures best practices are followed when integrating with HyperSwitch

## How It Should Work
The SDK should provide a fluent, intuitive interface for developers to:
1. Initialize the SDK with their API credentials
2. Create and confirm payments
3. Process refunds
4. Manage customers and payment methods
5. Handle errors gracefully with detailed information

All operations should support async/await patterns, follow .NET conventions, and provide adequate documentation.

## User Experience Goals
- **Simplicity**: Developers should be able to integrate payments in just a few lines of code
- **Transparency**: The SDK should provide clear feedback on what's happening
- **Flexibility**: Support both strongly-typed models and dictionary-based requests to accommodate different developer preferences
- **Reliability**: Handle edge cases and provide meaningful error messages
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive examples that show complete payment flows

## Target Users
- .NET developers integrating payments into web applications, mobile backends, or desktop applications
- Development teams building e-commerce platforms using .NET technologies
- Financial technology companies using .NET for payment processing systems

## Expected User Journey
1. Developer installs the SDK via NuGet
2. Initializes the client with API credentials
3. Creates a payment with customer and payment method details
4. Confirms the payment
5. Retrieves payment status
6. Issues refunds as needed

The SDK should make this journey as seamless as possible with minimal code and maximum clarity.
