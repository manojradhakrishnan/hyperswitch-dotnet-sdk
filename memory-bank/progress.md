# HyperSwitch .NET SDK - Progress

## What Works
- **Core Client Implementation**: The `HyperSwitchClient` class provides a robust HTTP client with authentication and error handling
- **Payments API**: Complete implementation of the Payments API endpoints (create, retrieve, confirm, capture, cancel)
- **API Models**: Type-safe models for requests and responses
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with detailed exception information
- **Logging**: Configurable request/response logging
- **Multi-version Support**: Compatible with .NET 6.0, 7.0, 8.0, 9.0
- **Documentation**: Extensive README with usage examples and API reference

## What's In Progress
- **Additional API Coverage**: Ensuring all HyperSwitch API endpoints are covered
- **Enhanced Testing**: Expanding test coverage for all SDK components
- **Documentation Improvements**: Enhancing documentation with more detailed examples
- **Performance Optimization**: Identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks

## What's Left to Build
- **Webhook Handling**: Comprehensive webhook handling for payment notifications
- **Advanced Authentication**: Support for additional authentication methods if added to HyperSwitch
- **Expanded Examples**: More comprehensive example applications
- **Additional API Endpoints**: Support for any new endpoints added to the HyperSwitch API

## Current Status
The SDK is fully functional and can be used to:
- Create and process payments
- Handle refunds
- Manage customers and payment methods
- Handle errors gracefully

It is ready for use in production applications, with ongoing maintenance and feature additions as the HyperSwitch API evolves.
